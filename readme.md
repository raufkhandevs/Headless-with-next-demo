In this code I've set up a Next.js project that uses Static Site Generation (SSG) to create a single static page. I'm pulling in data from WordPress using GraphQL.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the code:

Apollo Client Setup: I've set up Apollo Client to connect to the WordPress GraphQL API.

GraphQL Query: I’ve got a query that fetches page content and ACF blocks based on a page slug.

Block Render Component: I’m creating a BlockRender component that renders different types of ACF blocks. This keeps the page component clean.

Next.js Page Component: The page uses getStaticProps to fetch data at build time and getStaticPaths to determine which pages to pre-render.

Benefits:

Modularity: By separating out the block rendering into its own component, our main page component stays neat and focused on layout.
Performance: With SSG, the page is pre-rendered at build time. This means faster load times because the HTML is served directly, not generated on each request. It also helps with SEO since static pages are easy for search engines to index.
Caching: Since the pages are static, they’re cached by CDNs, so users get super quick load times.
Performance Example:

First Visit: The static HTML page is served almost instantly from the CDN.
Subsequent Visits: Cached content means the page loads even faster with minimal server calls.
So, with this setup, we get a snappy, SEO-friendly page while keeping the code organized and manageable.
